**Hello! I am a PhD student at Georgia Institute of Technology in the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy. I am co-advised by Professor Paul Pearce and Professor Frank Li.**

I research Internet measurement with an emphasis on understanding the state of IPv6 deployment.
I am broadly interested in cybersecurity and the Internet. 
My other experience includes network verification and systems security. 

I graduated in May 2021 the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering. There, I was advised by Professor Matthew Caesar.
