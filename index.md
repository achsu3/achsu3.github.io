![](me.jpg)

**Hello! My name is Amanda and I'm a PhD student at Georgia Institute of Technology in the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy. I am co-advised by Professor Paul Pearce and Professor Frank Li.**

My research experience has focused on network verification, systems security, and Internet measurement, but I am broadly interested in security and the Internet in general.

I graduated in May 2021 the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering. There, I was advised by Professor Matthew Caesar.
